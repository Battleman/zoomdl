# THIS APPLICATION IS ARCHIVED
I don't use Zoom anymore, lack access to any kind of SSO to test critical parts of the application, and have currently other focus. This application may or may not work. This was developed early in the boom of Zoom at work and in classrooms, as a quick and dirty way to download videos marked as non-downloadable (which I hate). I shared with a few friends, shared it here, and it kinda grew a bit. At the time, other apps such as youtube-dl hadn't caught up, and often didn't work easily. They are now up to date and work just fine. 

I'm glad this application helped people. I'm now retiring it. Anyone is welcome to fork and keep developing it, as long as the license is respected.

Peace

## Goal
Conferences, meetings and presentations held on Zoom are often recorded and stored in the cloud, for a finite amount of time. The host can chose to make them available to download, but it is not mandatory.

Nonetheless, I believe if you can view it, you can download it. This script makes it easy to download any video stored on the Zoom Cloud. You just need to provide a valid zoom record URL, and optionally a filename, and it will download the file.

## Availability
The script was developed and tested under GNU/Linux (precisely, Debian 10). Thus, it should work for about any GNU/Linux distro out there, with common settings. You basically only need Python3 in your path.

*New from 2020.06.09* There now exists an executable file `zoomdl.exe` for Windows. It was kinda tested under Windows 10. Because I never coded under Windows, I have very few tests, mostly empirical ones. Expect bugs! If you encounter a Windows-specific error, don't expect much support. If the error is related to the general logic of the program, report it and I'll do my best to fix it.

## Installation
### Linux/OSX
You need to have a valid Python3 installation. Except from that, just download the script `zoomdl` (not `zoomdl.exe`) and run it like a normal binary. If you wish to make it available system-wide, you can copy it to `/usr/local/bin/` (or anywhere else available in your PATH). Then you can simply use it wherever you want.

The following two commands make that easy. In a terminal, run:
```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/Battleman/zoomdl/releases/latest/download/zoomdl -O /usr/bin/zoomdl
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/zoomdl
```
You will be prompted to enter your password (your computer password, not zoom). It's likely that you won't see anything as you type it, don't worry, it [is normal](https://askubuntu.com/questions/112069/nothing-shows-up-in-the-terminal-when-i-type-my-password) ([even for OSX](https://osxdaily.com/2015/02/04/terminal-wont-show-password-when-typed/))

Once you have done that, you can use your terminal and type the commands normally.

### Windows
**This is still in beta**
Grab the dedicated binary `zoomdl.exe`, and launch it using your command line. If you don't know how, visit [this wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Run-an-EXE-File-From-Command-Prompt). You may encounter warning from your anti-virus, you can ignore them (I'm not evil, pinky-promise). You probably don't need a Python3 installation, it *should* be contained within the executable.

If there is a domain in your url, make sure to include it, it's crucial.
## Usage
`zoomdl [-h] -u/--url 'url' [-f/--fname 'filename'] [-p/--password 'password'] [-c/--count-clips count] [-d/--filename-add-date] [--user-agent 'custom_user_agent'] [--save-chat (txt|srt)] [--chat-subtitle-dur number] [--save-transcript (txt|srt)] [--dump-pagemeta]`
* `-u/--url` is mandatory, it represents the URL of the video
* `-f/--fname` is optional, it is the name of the resulting file _without extension_. If nothing is provided, the default name given by Zoom will be used. Extension (`.mp4`, `.mkv`,... is automatic)
* `-p/--password` is too optional. Set it when your video has a password.
* `-c/--count-clips`: Sometimes, one URL can contain multiple clips. This tunes the number of clips that will be downloaded. Recordings with multiple clips seem to be quite rare, but do exist. The parameter `count` works as follow:
  * 0 means: download all of them (starting from the current clip)
  * 1 means: download only the first/given clip
  * \> 1 means: download until you reach this number of clip (or the end)
* `-d/--filename-add-date` will append the date of the recording to the filename. **without effect if `-f` is specified**
* `--user-agent` (no shorthand notation): lets you specify a custom User-Agent (only do that if you know what you're doing and why)
* `--cookies` (no shorthand notation): specify the path to a cookie jar file.
* `--save-chat` (no shorthand notation): save chat messages in the meeting to either a plain-text file or `.srt` subtitle file. Known issue for this function: #70
* `--chat-subtitle-dur` (no shorthand notation): set the duration in seconds that a chat message subtitle appears on the screen. The default value is 3 (seconds). Only works when you specify `--save-chat srt`.
* `--save-transcript` (no shorthand notation): save audio transcripts in the meeting to either a plain-text file or `.srt` subtitle file.
* `--dump-pagemeta` (no shorthand notation): dump the page's meta data to a json file for further usages. Usually you do not need this.

### Cookies / SSO / Captcha / Login
Some videos are protected with more than a password. You require an SSO, or to solve a captcha. The `cookies` option allows you to perform all the steps in a browser, and then use the cookies to access the video. This functionality is similar to Youtube-dl's same option.

**Howto:**
1. (Only once, the first time) In your favourite browser (works for Firefox-based or Chrome-based), install a cookies-export extension. Cookies must some in the _Netscape format_. There are multiple extensions out there, chose your favourite. For example [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/), [Other Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies-txt/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid), [Other Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg)
2. With the same browser, visit the video you want to download; pass all required verifications (SSO, captcha, login,...), until you are able to view the video
3. Using the aformentioned extension, export your cookies. You need the cookies for the domain (`.zoom.us`), so export at least "cookies for this site", or "cookies for this domain", or whatever it's called.
4. Save generated file somewhere (for example, `Downloads/cookies.txt`)
5. When calling ZoomDL, use the option `--cookies path/to/the/cookies.txt`

If you want to download several videos who use the same login (like SSO), you only need to export the cookies once

### About syntax
I see a lot of people who don't understand what the above means. Here is a short explanation:
* This is a _command_, with multiple possible _parameters_.
* Parameters usually have a short version (with one dash, like `-u`) and an equivalent long version (with two dashes, like `--url`); the short and long version are shown separated by a `/`; you must only use one of them.
* The parameters between square brackets are optional (like `-f`, that allows you to input a custom filename). The others (for the moment, only `-u`) are mandatory.
* The order of parameters don't matter
* the `-h` parameter only displays a short help and commands explanation

For example, those are all valid commands (ofc by replacing the URLs):
```
zoomdl -u 'https://my_url' -f "recording_from_monday"
zoomdl --url 'https://my_url'
zoomdl -p '$28fn2f8' --filename-add-date --filename "recording_from_tuesday" -u 'https://my_url' --user-agent "Windows 10 wonderful User-Agent" -v 3
```
### About quotes [IMPORTANT]
The quotes are not mandatory, but if your filename/url/password/... contains reserved characters (`\`, `&`, `$`,`%`...), quotes are the way to go.

Under Linux/OSX, it is strongly advised to use *single quotes*, because `"4$g3.2"` will replace `$g3` by nothing, while `'4$g3.2'` will leave the string as-is.

Under Windows, I *think* you must use double quotes everywhere. Don't quote me on that.

### Validity of urls
There are 3 type of valid urls.
* Those starting with _https://zoom.us/rec/play/..._
* Or, with a domain, _https://X.zoom.us/rec/play/..._ where _X_ is a domain, something like _us02web_, _epfl_,... or similar.
* Finally, governemantal urls: _https://X.zoomgov.com/rec/play/..._ (same as above; X may be empty)

## Building from sources
If you wish to build from sources, here is a quick howto. First, you need to clone the repository and enter it with a terminal. Then:
### Linux
Run the command `./devscript.sh compile`. It basically installs all the dependencies with pip in a temporary directory, then zips it.

### Windows
* Install [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) (usually `pip install -U pyinstaller`)
* Run the command `wincompile.bat`. It calls just calls `pyinstaller` and cleans the generated folders and files, leaving only the exe file.

## Requirements
All dependencies are bundled within the executable. This allows to make a standalone execution without need for external libraries.

If you wish to build it yourself, see `requirements.txt`. The most important requirement is [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests). Please see [acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) for a note on that.

## Acknowledgements
The folder executable contains [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) (and its dependencies), an awesome wrapper for HTTP(s) calls. Please check them out!
